    A Man's Best Friend For many of us, the animals in our lives are our faithful pals who make us laugh, 
    that keep us company and love us no matter what. But a man’s best friend doesn’t necessarily have to be a dog; 
    I believe that any animal can be considered to be a man’s best friend. 
On the other hand they are many animals who don’t have the same luck as other animals do. For those animals life is 
hard for them on the streets .Most animals on the streets often suffer from hunger, illness, tumors, skin infections and
 open sores. They would often fight over the limited amounts of food found on the streets. They seek food and shelter in 
 communities and they are sometimes seen as a nuisance and health hazard by the people who live along them. 
The Dog home has been providing shelter to many street puppies found anywhere throughout the country
we provide them with a shelter and a proper care along with hygiene and proper training facilities too
which helps in the outgrowing of their mental stability as well as physical endurance. 
Animal shelters care for animals needing protection, attempt to find homes for homeless animals, and reunite 
lost pets with their owners. When necessary, animal shelters give homeless or unadoptable animals a humane death.
 Today’s shelters range from single rooms with multiple cages to state-of-the-art facilities with amenities that may
  rival some hotels.  The “luxury” features, like ambient music and waterfalls, serve to reduce the animals’ stress 
  and to make the shelter more inviting, which increases the chances that the animals at the shelter will find a new home.

Animal shelters can be structured in three ways. First, as municipal animal control agencies, run by city or county 
governments second, as non-profit agencies overseen by a board of directors or third, as private, non-profit agencies with
 a government contract to provide animal control services. </p>
